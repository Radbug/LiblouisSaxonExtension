Liblouis Saxon Extension

This project provides a command line tool to transform dtbook xml
source files [1] into a braille format proprietary to sbs [2].

It uses saxon [3] with a java extension that offers translating text
into braille using liblouis [4].

# Usage:

cd LiblouisSaxonExtension
./dtbook2sbsform.sh dtbook.xml
# calls saxon.sh, transform dtbook.xml
# and performs line breaking using linebreak.sh
# printing output onto stdout

./saxon.sh
# calls saxon, offering its rich command line interface,
# includes our extension function
# (see resources/xsl/dtbook2sbsform.xsl

./linebreak.sh
# breaks lines according to sbs rules:
# only lines beginning with a blank will be broken
# line width is 80 chars.

Prerequisite installs:
- liblouis [4]
