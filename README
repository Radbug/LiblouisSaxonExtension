Liblouis Saxon Extension

This project provides a specialized javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory
that can be used to configure applications that respect the
System property "javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory".

It uses saxon [3] with a java extension that offers translating text
into braille using liblouis [4].

Usage org.liblouis.LouisExtensionTransformerFactoryImpl:

java -Djavax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory YourAppThatUsesJaxp
Examples can be found in the xsl tests which are performed using
utf-x [5]. See utfx.sh shell script in project [6].
